    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        My full name is Russ Scott Bermejo. I was born in the Philippines and I came to the US when I was 10.
        Ever since I was little I've always been facinated with computers and the evolution of technology.
        I loved playing video games and always wondered how they were made. I came across
        Computer Science when I was a senior in High School and I loved the idea and challenges that came with it.
        After graduating, I went to University of Illinois at Chicago and majored in Computer Science. I want to
        become a web developer because it gives me freedom and gives me satisfaction to build a website for my
        consumers.
